    <h1>Privacy Policy for OCommute</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [November 2, 2025]</p>
    
    <p>
        Thank you for using OCommute. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices. 
        "We," "us," and "our" refer to [Your Name or Company Name as Publisher].
    </p>

    <h2 class="highlight">Information We Collect (and Why)</h2>
    <p>
        OCommute is a transit app, and its core features depend on location data. We are very clear about when and how we use this data.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Location Data (While App is in Use):</strong> 
            We collect your precise location (using GPS and network signals) <strong>only when the app is open and visible on your screen</strong>. 
            We use this to provide our main features: finding nearby stops, planning trips from your current location, and showing you real-time transit information.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>[OPTIONAL - DELETE IF NOT USED]</strong>
            <strong>Location Data (In the Background):</strong> 
            If you enable features like "Get-Off Alerts," we will ask for permission to track your location in the background (when the app is closed). 
            We use this *only* to monitor your trip and send you a notification when you are approaching your stop. This data is not used for any other purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Analytics Data (Non-Personal):</strong>
            We collect anonymous analytics data, such as app crashes and feature usage statistics. 
            This helps us find and fix bugs and understand what features are most popular. This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>In-App Purchases (Freemium)</h2>
    <p>
        OCommute offers optional premium features through in-app purchases. 
    </p>
    <p class="highlight">
        <strong>We do not process these payments ourselves.</strong> 
        All transactions are handled directly by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. 
        We never receive, see, or store your credit card number or billing information.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We only share information in these limited cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>[DELETE IF NOT USED] With Mapping Providers:</strong> 
            To display maps, we may share anonymized location data with our mapping service provider (e.g., Apple Maps, Mapbox).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>With Law Enforcement:</strong> 
            We may disclose information if required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>
        You are in control. You can disable location services for OCommute at any time through your device's settings. 
        If you do, the app's core features (like finding nearby stops) will not function.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable steps to protect your information, but no security system is impenetrable. 
        We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, 
        we will notify you through the app or by posting the new policy here.
    </p>
